Client Co-ordinates Revealer v2.0 - By Madhur Ahuja
===================================================

Client Co-ordinates Revealer(CCR) is an excellent program for those who would like to quickly locate the co-ordinates of any window. it may be either child or parent window.
I made this program because i had difficulty in accurately placing the bitmaps,icons on my win32 programs.
The co-ordinates can be used in API functions like BitBlt,TranspareBlt...

Changes
