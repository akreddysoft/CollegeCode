Virtual Address to File Offset - Madhur Ahuja
5th October 2003
=============================================
VA2Offset is a nifty utility to convert the virtual address seen under debuggers like
softice,ollydbg etc to offsets of the file. Virtual address supplied can reside in any of the
section or in header of the Portable Executable File. Currently the program supports only
Portable Executable Files. Future version will support dynamic link libraries also.
I have tested this program on Win98/2000. 

Made in 100% Win32 assembly (using MASM32). If you like/hate this program, want to suggest 
improvements, report bug plz email me at madhur_ahuja@yahoo.com

P.S. This program is freeware, so you can share it around; just dont ask money for it (hey,
who would pay for this anyway?) And yeah, use this program at your own risk, I cant be held
responsible for any damage caused; but trust me, nothing bad will happen....
