max array size dimession is 65535 bytes

imp doubt
when a struct of 14 bytes is written into file using fstream (ios::app) ,if we do not specify ios::binary
the file is written of 15 bytes, if we specify binary then it is written as 14 bytes 

now while reading we do not specify the ios::binary it reads correctly first 12 records but after it reads wrongly even if we write data using ios::binary.
thus its compulsory to mention ios::binary whenever fiddling with binary file.
