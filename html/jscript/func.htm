<!--include function in the header-This ensures that all functions have been parsed before it is possible for user 
events to invoke a function. This is especially relevant once you begin working 
with event handlers where incorrect placement of a function definition can mean 
an event can lead to a function call when the function has not been evaluated 
and Navigator doesn't know it exists. When this happens, it causes an error 
message to be displayed.-->
