MOV AX,@DATA
MOV DS,AX

MOV 	AX,ITEMA
MOV 	BH,BYTE PTR [ITEMA]     ;THIS ONE IS SAME AS ABOVE STATEMENT
MOV 	CX,OFFSET ITEMA
LEA	DX,ITEMA
XOR	DX,DX
MOV	DX,WORD PTR [DATE] ;THIS ONE IS SAME AS BELOW;BOTH LOADS CONTENTS OF DATE
MOV	DX,WORD PTR DATE
LEA	DX,[DATE]  ;THIS WORKS  ,THIS ALSO WORKS LEA DX,DATE
MOV	AH,9H
INT	21H

MOV	AX,04H
MOV	DX,AX      ;THIS WORKS AS LONG AS DATE IS AT 4THBYTE IN DS
MOV	AH,9H
INT	21H

CALL	SET2
MOV	CX,[BX]    ;ONLY BX OR INDEX REGISTER CAN BE USED FOR INDIRECT
LEA	CX,[BX]    ;THIS ONE IS SAME AS BELOW,;LOAD THE ADDRESS OF CONTENTS OF ADDRESS:1234H,WHICH IS THE ADDRESS ITSELF
MOV	CX,BX
;MOV	AX,[DX]         ;ERROR
;MOV	CX,[DX] 	;ERROR		;ADDRESSING, OTHERS WILL GIVE ERROR

;;;;;;;;;;;;;VERY INPORTANT CONCEPT BELOW
XOR	AX,AX
LEA	AX,A3
MOV	A2,AX
MOV	DX,[A2]      ;THIS DOESNT WORD ALSO, THE CONTENTS OF A2 ARE LOADED RATHER THAN CONTENTS OF DS:A2
;MOV	DX,BYTE PTR [A2]
MOV	AH,09H
INT	21H

MOV	DX,[04H] ;THIS DOESNT WORK TOO TURBO ASSEMBLER GIVE WARNING
MOV	AH,09H     ;[04] IS TAKEN AS IMMEDIATE RATHER THAN DS:04H

;THE CONCLUSION IS THAT INDIRECT ADDRESSING WORKS ONLY WITH BX AND INDEX REG
;REGISTER AND NOTHING ELSE,NOT EVEN VARIABLES,IMMEDIATE VALUES
