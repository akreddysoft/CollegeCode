if in softice one traces(p) through single instructions like xor ax,ax then
int 8 doesnt occurs. but if one encounters any instruction which takes branch
lilke jmp or any int then int 8 occurs and softice snaps to int 8 if bpint8 is set.

also,suppose there are 2 instructions like this
xor ax,ax
xor bx,bx

if one does simple trace through the 2 instructions then int 8 doesnt occurs
but if one transfers control from first to second instructin by using jump to g
here(f7) then int 8 snaps.

build a program which will write to a file whenever int 8 occurs. also write
