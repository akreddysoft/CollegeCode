<!--if the file is loaded from the localhost or website then path like this can work-->
<!--<a href="/cgi-bin/first.cgi">click to launch cgi script</a>-->
<!--because the path generated in the browser will be of type http://localhost/cgi-bin/first.cgi
which is the correct virtual path of the file.

if the file is loaded from any other drive folder loacation the path like this
<a href="/cgi-bin/first.cgi">click to launch cgi script</a>
will be takes as  file:///H:/cgi-bin/first.cgi and fill will just be loaded rather than executed.
so in that case full path must be specified as -->

<a href="http://localhost/cgi-bin/first.cgi/this is the path info?THIS IS THE QUERY STRING">click to launch cgi script</a>
<!-- the path given above must be virtual path(or web path) specified in web server configuration
     and not the actual directory path, if actual directory path , cgi program will
     be just loaded rather than executed-->
